                        Brand Signages designed a customized Acrylic LED outdoor sign board featuring
                        the Fortis Hospital logo and name, maintaining precise color consistency as per brand guidelines.
                        The signage was fabricated to stand out both during the day and at night, ensuring maximum
                        visibility
                        to patients and visitors.

                        <li class="mb-3">
                            <strong>High Elevation Installation:</strong> The signage needed to be mounted at a considerable
                            height for maximum visibility, requiring the use of boom lifts and strict adherence to safety
                            measures.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-3">
                            <strong>Weather Constraints:</strong> The project timeline coincided with intermittent rains,
                            posing challenges for electrical and installation activities.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-3">
                            <strong>Limited Installation Time:</strong> Since hospital operations run round the clock,
                            installation had to be executed during specific off-peak hours to minimize disturbance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Brand Color Precision:</strong> Maintaining the exact Fortis green color across acrylic
                            and LED illumination required extensive testing and calibration.
                        </li>
