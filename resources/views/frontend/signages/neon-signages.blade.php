        <button class="faq-question">
            What are Neon Light Signs Made of?
          <i class="faq-icon fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Neon light signs are manufactured from glass tubes filled with inert gases like neon, mercury vapor, and argon. 
            When an electric current goes through the gases, they ionize and emit light. Different gases create different colors, 
            with neon gas producing the classic red-orange glow. We also provide modern alternatives like LED technology for better 
            energy efficiency and durability.</p>

            What is The Delivery Timing for a Neon Sign Order?
          <i class="faq-icon fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The delivery timing for neon sign boards  generally is between 7-10 business days, based on the personalization and order size.</p>

            How Long Do Neon Light Signs Typically Last?
          <i class="faq-icon fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Neon light signs generally have a lifespan of approximately 15,000 to 30,000 hours, depending on several factors such as usage, 
            environment, and the materials used. Proper maintenance & care can extend the lifespan, ensuring the sign remains vibrant and 
            functional for years. It's worth noting that LED neon signs, which are energy-efficient alternatives, can last significantly longer, 
            often reaching up to 50,000 hours or more.</p>

            Can Neon Light Signs be Used Outdoors?
          <i class="faq-icon fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes, neon light signs can be used outdoors if they are specifically designed with durable, weather-resistant materials and waterproof features. Whether it is a garden party or an open-air rooftop dinner, neon lights can illuminate the space with their bright charm.</p>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Neon light signs are energy-efficient compared to incandescent lighting. They consume less power due to the use of inert gases and low voltage. However, modern alternatives like LED neon signs are even more energy-efficient, offering lower power consumption and longer lifespans while maintaining vibrant illumination.</p>

            What is The Installation Process for Neon Light Signs?
          <i class="faq-icon fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Neon signs are usually mounted on a wall, hung from ceilings, or placed on supports. The installation process involves securing 
            the sign, connecting the power supply, and ensuring proper wiring. Traditional neon signs require an expert installation due to the 
            glass tube and high voltage requirements. LED neon signs are easier to install, frequently using easy wall supports or adhesive backing. 
            For outdoor usage, proactive coating is necessary. It is essential to follow safety guidelines and work with experts for safe installation 
            and lasting durability.</p>

            What Maintenance is Required for Neon Light Signs?
          <i class="faq-icon fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Neon light signs require cleaning to remove dust, keeping them bright and visible. Use a smooth fabric or a dry brush to clean the tubes gently. 
            Avoid using strong water jets or harsh chemicals, mainly in conventional neon signs. Periodically, check the power supply and connections to ensure 
            proper functioning. LED neon signs require minimal preservation as compared to conventional neon, which may require gas refills over time. With 
            proper care, neon signs can last for years at the same time as retaining their brightness and effectiveness.</p>
